                    <h3 class="epunda-slab-h heading subh">"The oldest club on campus"</h3>
                    <p>Our club is the oldest on campus by technicality, as it's gone through many different forms on both colleges that would combine to become the University of Lowell, and later, UMASS Lowell.
                         The oldest mentions of the club put its origin as 1905 at the latest.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were 2 theatre programs for Lowell Normal School--later Lowell State College--and Lowell Technical Institute (also known as the Technological Institute or the Textile Institute at different points).
                         The former began as an all women's school and featured prominent gender bending/drag and vice versa for the all men's school that was the Technical Institute.
                         The name Off-Broadway Players came into use as early as 1991, predating the University of Lowell merger by 2 years. The original names were the "Drama Club" for Lowell State and "Textile Players" for the Technical Institute. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We started as purely Shakespeare performers on South Campus/Lowell State (our first recorded production being Shakespeareâ€™s A Midsummer Night's Dream) and, unfortunately, as minstrel/vaudeville shows on North Campus/the Technical Institute.
                        To date the most frequently performed play is still A Midsummer Night's Dream at least 6 separate productions.
                        The Textile Players used to perform at the Boston and Maine station downtown until it burned down 3 times and they gave up fixing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've collaborated with practically every group under the sun, including Pride Alliance for Laramie Project in 2010, what was formerly known as MENC (Music Education National Conference) which was the music program here,
                         and the ASAO/BSU on what were referred to as "Harlem Nights" where traditional African American/Harlem style performances took place.
